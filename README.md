# VantaDB
This is my personal project to learn about databases, and different aspects of it. I'm trying to build a key-value database from scratch, and I will be documenting my progress here. It even uses a custom binary file to store the entire metadata on disk. 

# Features
- Key-Value Store
- Custom Binary File Format
- WAL(to be implemented in future)
- Built from scratch in Golang
- Lots of learning about file systems, data structures and database internals.
